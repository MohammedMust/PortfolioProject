# Data Analyst Workflow: Call Center Complaint Analysis (VOC)

## 1. Data Collection
- Gather customer complaint logs/export (CSV, Excel, database, etc.).
- Typical fields: Date, Customer ID, Complaint Type, Call Duration, Agent Name, Resolution Status, Complaint Details.

## 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Remove duplicates and incomplete records.
- Standardize complaint categories (e.g., billing, service, technical issue).
- Format dates and customer identifiers.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Basic Counts: Total complaints, complaints per category, per agent, per time period.
- Trend Analysis: Plot complaints over time (line charts).
- Category Breakdown: Pie or bar charts of complaint types.
- Resolution Metrics: % resolved vs. unresolved, average resolution time.
- Sentiment Analysis: (Optional) Tag complaints as positive/negative/neutral using keywords.

## 4. Insights & Recommendations
- Identify top complaint drivers.
- Highlight recurring issues or bottlenecks.
- Suggest actionable improvements (e.g., more agent training, process changes).

## 5. Visuals & PPT Creation
- Use Excel to create charts (bar, pie, line) and summary tables.
- Export charts/images or copy tables to PowerPoint slides.
- Structure PPT:
  - Introduction (Purpose, Data Overview)
  - Key Metrics (Charts, Tables)
  - Complaint Analysis (Trends, Categories)
  - Insights & Recommendations
  - Next Steps/Action Plan
